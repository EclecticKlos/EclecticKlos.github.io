    <h2>Tech Issue</h2>
    <p>
      Having been in the tech industry for some time, at least in the non-technical capacity, one thing I've learned over the past few years that I find quite troublesome is the fact that the valuations of many of the more social-oriented tech startups/companies have been astronomical.  These incredibly high valuations draws in venture capital dollars as well as increased M&A activity. All of this, then, translates into lucrative jobs--engineering jobs--with the attractive incentive of potentially winnign the buy-out lottery and being set for life with millions of dollars. With so much activity in the space and near-zero startup costs, it's easy for engineers to be drawn to the lifestyle dream of living wherever they want, working for great pay, and potentially even on their own startup for a large cash-out, unlike traditional engineering jobs or even just a hardware/hard science-oriented startup.

    Thus, some of the world's highest-potential engineers are all going in to software, and what's worse, many of these engineers are working on things that ostensibly have no real value to society (or at least are not created with the intention as such) but rather to make the engineer/founder money.
