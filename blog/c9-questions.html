    <h2>How to ask a question</h2>
    <p>
      Most questions I've asked at DBC thus far I've felt I did a relatively good job asking. One exception was asking a questions before I'd really thought about it, and so I felt pretty darn silly when the answer was quite obvious. Lesson learned: think before you ask! But a more tricky situation that arose was when I was trying to give feedback to the cohort about feedback. I posted something to the effect that the feedback I'd been reading was very formulaic and completely unspecific or frankly even completely useless.
    <br>
      When I provided the feedback, I stated what I had observed and provided a link to the resources at DBC for feedback. It turns out that this was perceived as being critical of, even "mean" to, my fellow cohort mates, which was definitely not my intention! I realized that phrasing really, really matters, to the point where someone else posted a rather lengthy reply to mine that several people had a discussion about it and stated that my comments were "unproductive". To be honest, I'm still a bit puzzled why it was taken personally, but I learned my lesson: pay attention to phrasing, and when offering feedback to a group, write it so that individuals are less likely to read it and interpret it as something written specifically to/about them and moreso about best practices; promote a proactive approach rather than admonishment.
