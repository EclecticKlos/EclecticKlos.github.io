    <h2>How computers work</h2>
    <p>
      Computers can seem like magical boxes, with our fingers and hands making requests and sending commands, and output seeming to just appear. If you're a bit older, you may recall your machine making strange noises now and again, particularly when you were opening a large file. This was very likely the hard drive, which used to be disks (platters) that would spin in your computer to save information, but is increasingly being done with solid stated (hard) drives, or SSDS. SSDs are like the USB memory sticks you can carry in your pocket. Think of the hard drive or SSD as what you might refer to as your "long term memory".
    <br>
      The information stored on the hard drive can be interacted with by the user via the CPU, or central processing unit. Those stickers that come on Window's computers sporting "Intel Inside" are referring to the manufacturer of the CPU (Intel, in this case). The CPU is essentially the brain portion of the computer, or the thing that processes information.
    <br>
      In order for the CPU to process information from the hard drive or other medium (such as from the internet or a USB drive), chunks of information are stored in what is the equivelent to our brains "short-term" memory, or RAM (random access memory) for computers. Interfaces are also stored in short-term memory, given their fleeting and constantly changing nature. Thus, when you have many windows open at once, your computer will sometimes slow down--you are running out of RAM and/or processing power to handle all of the information.
