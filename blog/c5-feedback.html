    <h2>Pairing Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Pairing at Dev Bootcamp has been quite a learning experience. A pair is when you get together, generally via Google Hangouts, with a fellow boot and write code together. The process involves having one person designated the driver, while the other is the navigator. The driver's job is to take control of the keyboard and focusing on typing. The navigator keeps an eye on the objective and tells the driver what to type, ideally keystroke by keystroke.

      While I believe one of the intents of this coding method is to help promote a particular focus for each person, I've been finding the biggest payoff to be skillshare and something that is a little more difficult to explain... almost like a mindset share. Particularly when you are driving, you get to see letter by letter how the other person approaches problem solving. It's rare in life that you get the opportunity to be so patient and so competely a passive part of what someone else is doing, especially solving complex problems. The effect is that you learn new ways to think about and approach problems, which I think may be one of the most profound payoffs for learnign at DBC.

      Pairing can also offer its challenges. If you feel more skilled than your pair or you have already completed the challenge, it can be difficult not to become impatient and allow frustration to creep in. At the beginning of each pairing session and throughout, I try to remind myself that this is an opportunity to exercise patience and understanding with others. Likewise, you're likely to present someone else with the exact same opportunity! You can't be the best at everything and sooner or later you're going to be the person slowing things down, and that's when it's a good time to be humble and ask for help. Being straight with your pair and describing your issue precisely makes it all the easier for them understand what your hang up is and work to help you with a solution.

      At the end of each pairing session, you are asked to provide feedback to your pair. This comes in the form of an anonymous paragraph or two delivered through DBC's "feedbackinator" program. So far, I've found feedback to be quite helpful, though early on I think people are being a little more leanient than they may have to be. Some feedback is a bit more generalized toward a personality and seemingly to flatter a person rather than give something thoughtful and actionable from which they can grow personally and technically with.  I think my most common piece of feedback is to try to stick to the pair format of driver/navigator, as there is so much value to be derived from that vs the two of you just sort of hacking away simultaneously. I think the most consistent theme in my feedback is that I could probably arrive to a session with a bit of a better understanding of the problem so that I'm not Googling concepts during the session. While a lot of people do this, I think having a clear understanding of which tools you intend to utilize to solve a problem makes for a stronger starting point than a blank slate, especially if your pair has done some prep work as well.

      The most difficult part about feedback for me comes down to time management. I really need to make it a habit of scheduling more time at the end of a pairing session to give them feedback immediately while it is fresh in my mind rather than trying to recall details about a session at the end of the week. Otherwise, I find both receiving and giving feedback to be a fun and rewarding experience.
