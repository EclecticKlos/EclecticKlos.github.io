The benefits of version control are many:
Mistakes can be reverted to a previous working version.
No lost code.
No out-dated backups.
No maintaining multiple versions of a product.
Can see the difference between versions of a product.
Troubleshooting.
Code history access.
Can submit changes to other people's code.
Can share code.
Can see what is being done, by whom, and when.
Can experiment with new features out of production.

Git helps keep track of changes by creating a comprehensive and automatic log of changes via commits.  It highlights the areas that were modified, added and removed.

GitHub is a good place to store code because you can access it from anywhere, share it with anyone, it is backed up redunantly by GitHub.
