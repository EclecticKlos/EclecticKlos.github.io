    <h2>Tech Issue</h2>
    <p>
      Having been in the tech industry for some time, at least in the non-technical capacity, one thing I've learned over the past few years that I find quite troublesome is the fact that the valuations of many of the more social-oriented tech startups/companies have been astronomical.  These incredibly high valuations draws in venture capital dollars as well as increased M&A activity. All of this, then, translates into lucrative jobs--engineering jobs--with the attractive incentive of potentially winnign the buy-out lottery and being set for life with millions of dollars. With so much activity in the space and near-zero startup costs, it's easy for engineers to be drawn to the lifestyle dream of living wherever they want, working for great pay, and potentially even on their own startup for a large cash-out, unlike traditional engineering jobs or even just a hardware/hard science-oriented startup.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thus, some of the world's highest-potential engineers are all going in to software, and what's worse, many of these engineers are working on things that ostensibly have no real value to society (or at least are not created with the intention as such) but rather to make the engineer/founder money.

    <h2>Mapped Arrays and Hashes</h2>
    <p>
      The .map method is pretty nifty. Let's say you have an array of names:<br>
      names = ["john", "bill", "horace", "archbald"]<br>
      And you want to print each of these names with capital letters. Instead of writing some sort of loop, you can invoke the .map method on names and it will capitalize each element within the array. The code would look like this:<br>
      p names.map!{|n| n.capitalize}<br>
      output:<br>
      John<br>
      Bill<br>
      Horace<br>
      Archbald<br>
      So how did the code work?  First, the names array is called, which contains lower-case names. The .map method is invoked, and with an !. What this does is the .map will run the code in the block on each element within whatever .map is being called on, in this case names[]. The ! means that it will run this code destructively, meaning it will alter the object it's being called on (names[]) itself, so after .map! in this case runs the code block capitalizing each value of the names[] array, the names[] array will be altered itself, which is to say that names = ["John", "Bill", "Horace", "Archbald"] after this .map! array is called. For clarification: had .map been called (without the !) in this example, it would have resulted in the same output. However, if we wanted to use names[] elsewhere in the program and have it be capitalized, we would have to capitalize it once again, for without the ! the array itself remains untouched beyond that single invokation of .map.
