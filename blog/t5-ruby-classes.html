      Let's talk about classes. I remember when I first began leanring about classes in Java course I took back in college, the concept was very difficult to wrap my mind around relative to a method. I'm going to use example here to give you a better idea of what a class is relative to a method, and why bother are cornerstones to coding in Ruby. The example for a class I'm going to use is, well, a class :-).

      Put yourself back in elementary school. Remember you'd sit in a class, and the teacher would use a variety of methods to try to get a concept into your head? Take math class, for instance. You may have been given some rote memorization of the multiplication tables, or solving examples on the chalk board, or being assigned some homework. Each method was generally, but not always, unique to the class you were learning in. For example, you didn't model division with clay in art class, however, in most classes you likely received homework, except possibly in gym class.

      Coding class are similar. A class is a means of encapsulating methods that have a similar end or purpose. In much the same way that it makes sense to have teachers who specialize in particular subjects and to break those subjects into separate classes using different methods for learning, coding is broken into segments of code which specialize in performing a specific function.
