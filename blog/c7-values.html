## Release 1: Exploring your values
When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the
happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following
values come to mind?
Achievement
Compassion
Confidence
Coolness under fire
Creativity
Close Relationships
Meaningful work
Growth
Helping others

Release 2:
Meaningful work: Meaninful work to me is the confluence of all of the above. It is not trivial to produce meaningful work, and thus requires struggle, ultimately resulting in a true, unmatched sense of a achievement. To my mind, any meaningful work either directly or indirectly provides the opportunity to exercise compassion, be it the larger objective of the work, or something as simple as a more thoughtful widget to ease the experience of the user. If you're not confident, you will not achieve meaningful results; generally making a difference will at some point put you at odds with your own feelings, instincts, and almost certainly with those of others, and you must possess the confidence to press through. Likewise, meaningful work produces stressful situations, and keeping a cool head will be paramount to maintaining your relationships as well as your ability to think creatively in that moment. Thinking creatively is so closely tied to intelligence, or at least the output of intelligence, I'd say this is rather self-evident to the imporance of coming up with novel solutions to difficult problems (resulting in meaningful work). Close relationships are what will carry you through the bad times, and help give meaning to your high times when you can help others along. By helping others you are furthering humanity, our purpose and our cause.
And thus,pursing meaningful work is, to me, the confluence of all of these values.

Release 4:
The last topic someone asked me for advice on was a work-related issue, I think she was looking for big-picture tools to guide her thought process for an important work (stay or leave) decision she was up against.

Release 5:
When I think about my values, I feel really good about them. They are all geared toward ultimately helping others. I suppose one of several risks is becoming too "up my own ass" as I like to say, meaning that I'm so focused on "helping" that I may lose track of whether I am in fact producing something of value and solving a problem, or whether I'm inventing problems to solve and building/contributing to something that does not matter. Another potential risk is feeling as though progress isn't being made toward such a large and looming goal. Breaking down both my recent progress into measured, documented forms, creating more specific intermediate goals, as well as asking for feedback with regard to progress from others (particularly friends) could prove to be particularly potent for resolving said issues.
