    <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <p>
      I'm really impressed by DBC and that they are both aware of this problem and have taken steps to make we boots aware of it as well. Stereotype threat is something I can definitely see being an issue for some, perhaps all boots, and I can also definitely see how this knowledge will benefit us in the workplace.

      Stereotype threat is when someone's performance is hindered due to the fact that they fear that they are a part of some sort of stereotype and that they will reinforce the negative attributes of that stereotype with those around them. To me this sounds a bit similar to imposter syndrome, where someone is afraid that they've arrived where they are by chance or a fluke, and are thus unqualified to be where they are. However, the fallout from stereotype threat seem to be more far-reaching, or at least better documented as such, than imposter syndrome.

      I find it quite interesting that stereotype threat has been found to be a potential contributing factor to gender and racial achievement gaps in academics. It is thought to have more to do with one's situation than one's personality or genetic traits. Thus, it sounds as though the poeple with whom one is surrounded with may play a large role in contributing to the sense of belonging and thus not necessarily adding to whatever stereotype they may perceive themselves as belonging to. This is a topic I plan to keep in mind as I attend DBC and take beyond, as well as keeping in mind for myself! One of the biggest detrimental effects of stereotype threat is that it heavily impacts the working memory, which, as we all know, is highly utilized during programming.
