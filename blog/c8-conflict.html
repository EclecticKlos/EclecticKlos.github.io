    <h2>Conflict Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      The most recent and vivid conflict I had was with a woman with whom I had intercourse (sorry if this is TMI). I believe it is a vivid memory because I was impressed with how we both handled the situation. Basically, we had a situation where pregnancy might be a concern. The source of the conflict was that her religious beliefs were such that she'd only taken a pill once in her life, and thus taking a Plan-B pill the next morning was not something that she was thrilled with the prospect of doing. Very early on in the situation I noticed my fear of potential pregnancy and voiced my concern politely and gently. She acknowledged my concern and asked if I was thinking she should take Plan-B, which I said that I did think that was probably a good idea given that we are not very far along in our relationship.
    <br>
      I left it there, despite feeling increasing anxiety as the hours dragged on. Over the course of the next day I felt several impulses to call her and push her to go the to pharmacy, however I realized I was operating from a place of fear rather than trust, so I waited. At the end of that day she called me to inform me that she was in the process of taking the second pill of her life. She thanked me for not pressuring her as it made her feel as though it were her own decision rather than caving to pressure that I was applying to her. At teh end of this conflict, we both walked away more appreciative of one another, and a wonderful demonstration of trust now stands in our past as an example for future conflicts.
    <br>
      I honestly don't think I would do anything differently during the conflict at any point, and that's possibly one of the only conflicts, particularly one so emotionally stirring, about which I can say that. I learned that I need to be aware of the driving force behind my actions, and to dig deep, apply patience to the situation in order to adjust the place from which I am operating. By acting from a place of trust I ultimately got what I was hoping for out of it, and she was much more comfortable with the situation which was already inherently uncomfortable. Had I done the opposite and pressured her, I may very well have pushed her away from taking Plan-B and we both likely would have had ill will toward one another.
