Based on the fireside chat with Shereef, I am just all the more excited to be a part of, to contribute to and receive from DBC.  The kitchen vs customer mindset and approach to DBC was very compelling, specifically the philosophy of "come in, make a mess. We want you to be apologizing for taking control of your education."  The trust imparted upon the students is incredible, and interesting because we the students are placing a tremdendous amount of respect in the teachers/program, so it's really great to feel that is reciprocated.
I certainly hope to contribute as much as I can to the culture in as many ways as I can, from providing meaningful feedback to the program itself, to my fellow students, by setting an example through a positive attitude and openness and honesty.  I feel like this culture is perfect for me, both because I think I will very easily fit in with it but also because I think there is a tremendous amount of growth potential to be attained from it.
Right now the only concern I have is catching up.  I'm just wrapping up week 1 and we're halfway through week 2, so the next several days are going to have to be very focused for me.  It provides a good opportunity to start of very focused however :-)
